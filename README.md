# Frontend Projects ðŸš€

A repository of simple and kind-of advanced frontend projects made just for fun or when I'm in a toilet.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your favorite code editor.
3. Explore the different project folders and choose one that catches your eye.
4. Open the `index.html` file of your selected project in a web browser.
